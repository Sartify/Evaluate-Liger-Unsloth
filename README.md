# Liger Vs Unsloth Inference battle

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for evaluating different language models, focusing on performance metrics such as throughput and memory usage during inference.

## Notebooks

### 1. Evaluate Liger
This notebook evaluates the performance of the Liger model, focusing on:

- **Throughput**: Measures the number of tokens processed per second.
- **Memory Usage**: Tracks the peak GPU memory usage during inference.

### 2. Evaluate Unsloth
This notebook evaluates the performance of the Unsloth model, focusing on:

- **Throughput**: Measures the number of tokens processed per second.
- **Memory Usage**: Tracks the peak GPU memory usage during inference.
  
#### Preliminary Results
- **Total generated tokens**: 5402
- **Total time taken**: 277.00 seconds
- **Throughput (tokens per second)**: 19.50
- **Peak memory reserved (MB)**: 3144.00
